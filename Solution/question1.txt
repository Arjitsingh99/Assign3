GKE gives a lot of features which can be helpful for a business thinking about moving from another Kubernetes engine. 
1.	Easy Backup for data: GKE has systems in place which make it easy for developers and businesses to back up and secure their data.
2.	Account Security: With google accounts you can secure the application and make sure only the people you want to have access to the application and code can get access to it,
	and you can monitor progress. This also makes it easier to assign and reassign roles to members to tasks.
3.	Google VPN: This feature allows multiple networks and cluster IPs to be able to work together and coexist independent of each other on different servers.
4.	Security: GKE is monitored and backed by a large team of security personnel which can help with any problems and help keep the service secure.
5.	Cloud logging and monitoring: These services can be enabled to allow ease of access to logs and make monitoring of progress on your applications
	and projects easier so you can ask for any improvements or changes while the job is being done to improve efficiency.
6.	Scaling of application requirements: You can automatically scale the size of the application depending on how big you want the application to be 
	and how many people will you be serving with it so it can better suite your needs.
7.	Resource Limits: It is possible to put limits on how much computer resources your application will take and make sure that the application or service is tailored to your and the clientâ€™s needs.
GKE is a very valuable tool for an organization and well worth investing in since it can greatly help boost the performance and efficiency of the work done.
